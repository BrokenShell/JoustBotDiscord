# Joust

## The Joust
The knights charge each other on the open tournament field.
The first objective is - dismount the opponent.
While the second is - don't get dismounted.
Hitting your opponent is worth one point.

> Simply hitting an opponent is fairly easy, for a knight. 
> To win you must also best your opponent's balance, and knock them from their mount.

Dismounting your opponent is worth four extra points (five total).
The first knight to dismount the other wins the jousting match.
If both knights are dismounted in the same round the joust is a tie.
At the end of the match if no one has been dismounted, the match goes to the knight with the most points.
Winning a match can yield prizes and power.
